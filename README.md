# Books Lists App

Hello! Welcome to my "Books Lists App" project. This application organizes and displays books grouped by categories.

## Core Technologies

- **MVVM**: The Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern provides clear responsibility separation and improves code testability.
- **Kotlin**: All code is written in the Kotlin programming language, allowing for the use of modern language features.
- **Coroutines and Flows**: Utilized for asynchronous operations, providing ease of use and high performance.
- **Room**: Persistent data storage for efficient caching of books in the device's database.
- **Navigation Component**: Used for navigating between screens within the application.
- **Retrofit**: For executing network requests to an external API and fetching information about books.
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection for managing dependencies in the application.
